                    <li class="termspara">if you participate, we will collect certain Personal Information from you.
                        Participation in these sweepstakes, surveys or contests is completely voluntary and you

                </ul>

                <p class="termspara">Additional Information We Collect: From time to time, we may acquire additional

                    that assist us in the provision of products and services requested by you.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">CREDIT AND PAYMENT CARD INFORMATION</h4>

                <p class="termspara">LogoDesign.net uses third party payment processors Amazon and PayPal to process
                    payments made for products and services via the Website. All online payments will be conducted in
                    accordance with Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) data security standards and your billing information
                    (which is only used by these payment processors for the purpose of performing fraud protection) is
                    encrypted before being communicated to them. Subject to the below exceptions, your credit card
                    details are communicated directly from your browser to these payment processors – LogoDesign.net
                    does not see your full Permanent Account Number (PAN). This means that the payment form is either
                    off-site or displayed in a frame on the payment page.</p>

                <p class="termspara">For Amazon, if on the payment page you have requested that your card details be
                    remembered and the payment was successful, LogoDesign.net stores the card type, a Masked PAN (only
                    the first 6 and last 4 digits) and the card’s expiry date as well as an associated token. This
                    information is stored by us so that you and we can identify your stored card and use it for further
                    payments at LogoDesign.net. This stored information can be deleted via the payment form on the
                    Website should you wish to do so. We also store separately the last 4 digits and card type so that
                    we can identify transactions made by a particular card.</p>

                <p class="termspara">For PayPal we only store the tokens required to identify the transaction with
                    PayPal, issue refunds and identify transactions made using PayPal.</p>


                <h4 class="termhding">SPECIAL NOTIFICATION FOR EUROPEAN UNION RESIDENTS</h4>

                    perform services on our behalf. We may disclose Personal Information that we collect about you to
                    these companies to enable them to perform these services. By way of example, information relating to
                    your order which we have combined with other Personal Information (as explained above) may be shared
                    with our third party service providers that assist us with our marketing efforts.</p>

                <p class="termspara">Law Enforcement, Protection of LogoDesign.net and our Customers: We may also
                    disclose Personal Information in other circumstances as required by law. We also reserve the right

                    company to continue to do business as a combined entity. In the event that any such transaction
                    occurs, it is possible that our customer information, including your Personal Information, may be
                    transferred to the new business entity as one of LogoDesign.net’s assets. In such an event, we will

                <h4 class="termhding">UPDATING AND ACCESS TO YOUR PERSONAL INFORMATION</h4>


                <p class="termspara">If you wish to change your name, e-mail address, password, and/or communication
                    preferences after you have registered, you can access your account in the My Account section of the

                <h4 class="termhding">WEBSITE SECURITY</h4>

                <p class="termspara">We maintain physical, electronic, and procedural safeguards reasonably necessary to
                    ensure the protection of your Personal Information against loss, misuse, disclosure and alteration.
                    For example, we use Transport Security Layer (TSL) technology to encrypt your credit card
                    information when you purchase products through our Website. Basically, it takes a lot of effort to
                    break into this fortress.</p>

                <p class="termspara">When you establish an account at LogoDesign.net, you choose a password to help
                    protect your account information. A password is only as strong as you make it: you should select a
                    unique password and keep it safe. You may change your password as often as you wish by going to My
                    Account section of the Website. You are responsible for keeping this password confidential. We ask
                    you not to share a password with anyone. Our sign-in process is designed to help protect your
                    privacy. If you have trouble signing in to our Website, please ensure that you are using your
                    registered e-mail address and correct password. If you are using your registered e-mail address and
                    correct password, and you continue to have trouble signing in to our Website, please contact us
                    using the details below.</p>

                <p class="termspara">Notwithstanding the above, unfortunately, the transmission of information via the
                    internet is not completely secure. Although we will do our best to protect your Personal
                    Information, we cannot guarantee the security of your data transmitted to our Website; any
                    transmission is at your own risk.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">CHANGES TO THIS PRIVACY POLICY</h4>

                <p class="termspara">LogoDesign.net may revise this Privacy Policy from time to time by posting a
                    revised Privacy Policy on our Website and changing the last modified date at the top of the Privacy
                    Policy. If we make significant changes to the Privacy Policy, we will note the Privacy Policy has
                    changed on the main page of the Website and/or contact you by email. We reserve the right to modify
                    this Privacy Policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">COOKIES POLICY</h4>
                <p class="termspara">Like most websites, our Website LogoDesign.net uses "cookies" and files that are
                    similar to cookies. Our Cookies policy provides you with information on what cookies may be set when
                    you visit our Website and how to enable, control or delete those cookies. By using the Website, you
                    are agreeing to our use of cookies as particularized in this Cookies Policy.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">WHAT ARE COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">Cookies are text files containing small amounts of information which are downloaded
                    to your personal computer, mobile or other device when you visit a website.</p>
                <p class="termspara">Cookies do lots of different jobs, like letting you navigate between pages
                    efficiently, remembering your preferences, and generally improve the user experience. They can also
                    help to ensure that adverts you see online are more relevant to you and your interests.</p>
                <p class="termspara">Cookies send back information to the originating website on each subsequent visit,
                    or to another website that recognizes that cookie. Cookies are useful because they allow a website
                    to recognize a user's device.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">HOW WE USE COOKIES AT LogoDesign.net</h4>
                <p class="termspara">The following is a list of all the cookies used on our Website set out by category:
                </p>

                <h4 class="termhding">STRICTLY NECESSARY COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">These cookies are essential in order to enable you to move around the Website and
                    use its features, such as accessing secure areas of the Website. If you provide us with Personal
                    Information by filling out a form, registering for an account, making a purchase or contacting us,
                    we collect that Personal Information. For example, if you register on our Website, we collect your
                    name, e-mail address and password. If you place an order with us, we collect the Personal
                    Information that you provide to us such as your shipping, billing, and payment information. You may
                    also have the option to store credit card or other payment information to make it easier to purchase
                    products or service from the Website in the future. If you design and personalize a product, such as
                    a business card, we collect the Personal Information you use to customize the product, such as the
                    name of your business or your professional title. If you contact our customer support team, you may
                    also provide us with Personal Information that we collect. Without these cookies, services you have
                    asked for, like shopping baskets or e-billing, cannot be provided.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">PERFORMANCE COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">These cookies collect information about how visitors use the Website, for instance
                    which pages visitors go to most often, and if they get error messages from web pages. For example,
                    we automatically collect your IP address, the type of operating system and web browser you use and
                    related information. We also automatically track certain information about your activities on our
                    Website such as the pages you visit. These cookies don't collect information that identifies a
                    visitor. All information these cookies collect is aggregated and therefore anonymous. It is only
                    used to improve how the Website works.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">FUNCTIONAL COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">These cookies allow the Website to remember choices you make (such as your user
                    name, language or the region you are in) and provide enhanced, more personal features. These cookies
                    can also be used to remember changes you have made to text size, fonts and other parts of web pages
                    that you can customize. They may also be used to provide services you have asked for such as
                    watching a video or commenting on a blog.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">TARGET OR ADVERTISING COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">These cookies collect information about your browsing habits in order to make
                    advertising delivered to you more relevant to you and your interests. They are also used to limit
                    the number of times you see an advertisement as well as help measure the effectiveness of the
                    advertising campaign. They are usually placed by advertising networks with our permission. They
                    remember that you have visited a website and this information (in anonymous and aggregate form) is
                    shared with other organizations such as advertisers. Quite often targeting or advertising cookies
                    will be linked to site functionality provided by the other organization.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">THIRD PARTY COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">When you use our Website, your device or browser may be sent cookies from third
                    parties, for example when using embedded content and social network links. It's important for you to
                    know that we have no access to or control over cookies used by these companies or third party
                    websites. We suggest you check the third party websites for more information about their cookies and
                    how to manage them.</p>
                <p class="termspara">If you have purchased a website through LogoDesign.net, we only use one cookie on
                    LogoDesign.net hosted websites. We use this cookie to count the number of unique visitors, so we
                    know how many people visit the websites we host and to report that to you via your website
                    dashboard. This cookie is not used for anything else beyond this. It does not use or store any
                    personally identifiable information and other companies who provide websites like us, also use
                    similar types of cookies on their customers websites.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">HOW TO MANAGE COOKIES</h4>
                <p class="termspara">The Help menu on the menu bar of most browsers will tell you how to enable or
                    prevent your browser from accepting new cookies, how to have the browser notify you when you receive
                    a new cookie and how to disable cookies altogether. You can also disable or delete similar data used
                    by browser add-ons, such as Flash cookies, by changing the add-on's settings or visiting the website
                    of its operator.</p>

                <h4 class="termhding">CHANGES TO THIS COOKIE POLICY</h4>

                <p class="termspara">We may revise this policy from time to time by posting a revised policy on our
                    Website. We reserve the right to modify this policy at any time, so please review it frequently.</p>
